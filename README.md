# TelecomChurn_RF_SVM_Logistic
Telecom Churn Case study using Random forest, SVM and Logistic Regression

1.Use Random Forest, SVM and Logistic Regression for prediction.

2.Since the number of features are too many reduce the dimensionality using PCA.

3.The  model will only be able to achieve one of the two goals - to predict customers who will churn. We can’t use the above model to identify the important features for churn. That’s because PCA usually creates components that are not easy to interpret.

4.We build another model with the main objective of identifying important predictor attributes which help the business understand indicators of churn. A good choice to identify important variables is a logistic regression model or a model from the tree family.
